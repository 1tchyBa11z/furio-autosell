# furio-autosell

In light of all the BS with terrible way that the project is managed, this bot will save you having to look at the website and remind you of all the bad decisions the leadership have made.

- set RPC endpoint under RPC_URL
- add you private key(s) to PRIVATE_KEY, exclude the 0x and comma separate if multiple.
- If you aren't using a Telegram bot to get updates directly to your mobile, remove TELEGRAM_BOT and CHAT_ID from the .env file.

More details here: https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial

- There is an approve function, this is commented out as you can approve a large amount manually and then not need the additional step(cheaper to do it once).
